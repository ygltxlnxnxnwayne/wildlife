    The lion is a large cat of the genus panthera  native to Africa and India. <br>
    It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short,rounded head, round ears and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. <br>
    It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. <br>
    It is a social species, forming groups called prides. <br>
    A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, realated females and cubs. <br>
    Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on ungulates. <br>
    The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur. <br>
